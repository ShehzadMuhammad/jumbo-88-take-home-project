# Jumbo 88 Take Home Project

## Summary


I believe my redesign improves the current Jumbo88 promotions/packages page in several key ways, especially for first time purchasers.

I highlight the most relevant packages for new users (for example, "Best for New Players" and "Most Popular") to reduce decision fatigue and help guide them towards a decision. This follows the same idea you see at places like Costco, where showing a higher priced option first makes the standard option feel more attractive and valuable by comparison.

I simplify each deal card to keep it simple and more appealing to the eye in my opinion not too busy so its more digestible for a user. In the original the Promotions are shown then after is the Daily deals. I updated it in my design to be separated by tabs so its more obvious and easily navigated by a user instead of scrolling all the way down.

Overall, these changes are intended to improve first purchases chance by making the experience clearer, less overwhelming, and more guided for new users.
